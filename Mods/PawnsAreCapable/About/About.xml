	<description>Your colony has just survived a brutal pirate raid. Your base is on fire and all your colonists are downed save one--Priscilla the Pop Star Pirate. She's incapable of firefighting and doctoring and she sure isn't going to haul anything or do any cleaning. Guess your colony is done for. Or is it? Not if your pawns are capable!

This mod completely revamps the backstories and traits system in Rimworld. Pawns are now no longer incapable of performing jobs. However, based on their personal traits and backstories, they may not like the jobs assigned to them. Not only will they be extremely unhappy if you assign them a job they don't want to do, they will be slower at doing it, and more likely to do a bad job or even fail at it. But in a pinch, when your base is burning down or your doctors are incapacitated or you just need someone to do some hauling, all your pawns are 100% capable! * Thanks to Fluffy for helping with the C# code.</description>
