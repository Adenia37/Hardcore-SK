First of all, I would like to thank Fluffy, who suggested that I look at the CCL and this allowed me to move forward very quickly. Again, my many thanks Fluffy.

The minimap has undergone numerous changes (for the better):

1 - The areas that can be viewed are:
Colonist
Non-Colonist
Animals
Real Estate Management
Electrical network
Mining
Mountains
Land
Camera

2 - You can drag the map and resize the Map (After activating the option, click with the LMB and drag inside the Map.)

3 - Allow to visualize the areas created in the game

4 - Click on the MiniMap and move the camera in the world

In the image above, you have a MiniMap preview in a game.

NOTE: When you click on a Menu option, green square (enabled) or red square (disabled) is displayed. Just click to switch between options.
NOTE: Clicks are always with RMB (Right Mouse Button) and LMB (Left Mouse Button) to select item menu.
