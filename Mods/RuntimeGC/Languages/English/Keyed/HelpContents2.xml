	<HelpTextAG>CleanUp AvoidGrids

Enemies use AvoidGrid to keep them away from your traps,turrets,etc.
AvoidGrids are useless when there are no attacks,so clean them to reduce the size of your savegame(depending on the count and size of your map).

If you cannot tell the difference between Basic and Smart AvoidGrid,just use the recommended "Both".

Warning:Never do this cleaning when enemies are attacking!</HelpTextAG>
