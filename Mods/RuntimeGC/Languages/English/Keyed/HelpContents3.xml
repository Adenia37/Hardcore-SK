	<HelpTextAddOn>Additional CleanUp..



Animal Family tail-in:Sometimes there are too many members(dead or of other factions) in an animal family,and this function can remove them.Better use after cleaning World Pawns.



Remove Filth in HomeArea:Please, just don't use this function TOO often.

Remove Corpses in current map:Read the label again for its description.
	All the dead pawns in graves or anything like that will be ignored.</HelpTextAddOn>
	<HelpTextFix>Fix..



Faction Relationships:It could fix the DebugLog Error:"Faction xxx has null relation with xxx. Return Dummy relation." 
This tool could not fix the Error caused by the following mods:
	1.Misc. FactionBase:Error while generating maps,if a mechanoid is spawned.
	2.PPSMedicalCare (not for sure):Error during saving and loading,and that might become increasingly serious.



Faction Leaders:Generates leaders for factions so that you can use the Comms console again. A faction leader won't be replaced if a faction currently has one.</HelpTextFix>
	<HelpTextSysGC>Reclaim Memory



System.GC.Collect(),so memory(used by GameSystem) will be reclaimed.

Minor boost for game performance (and it returns to normal soon).</HelpTextSysGC>
